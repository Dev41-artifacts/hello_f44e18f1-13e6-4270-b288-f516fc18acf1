## Product Requirements Document for Ride-Hailing App Feature

### Feature: Verified Local Drivers

#### Purpose
To ensure user safety and build trust within the ride-hailing app, we will implement a feature that includes a system for verifying local drivers. The feature will emphasize the app's commitment to providing affordable rides while maintaining the integrity of driver qualifications.

#### Requirements

1. **Driver Verification Process**
   - **Background Check:** Implement a comprehensive background check process for each driver, covering criminal records, vehicle history, and employment verification.
   - **Identity Verification:** Use technology to verify the identity of drivers via government-issued ID, a selfie check, and address verification.
   - **Training Requirement:** All drivers must undergo training programs regarding safety, customer service, and local routes before they can accept rides.
   
2. **Driver Profile Display**
   - **Driver Information:** Each driver profile must display the driver's name, photo, verification status, vehicle details (make, model, color), vehicle registration number, and driver's ratings by users.
   - **Rating System:** Include a system that allows passengers to rate drivers based on their experience, with a summary of average ratings to be visible on their profile.

3. **User Interface**
   - **Driver Selection:** When hailing a ride, users should see a list of available drivers with their profiles, including verification status and ratings.
   - **Notifications:** Notify users of driver arrival along with their verification status and safety ratings.

4. **Feedback and Reporting Mechanism**
   - **Reporting Tools:** Allow users to report any issues related to driver behavior or safety via the app.
   - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a process for users to provide testimonials about their riding experience that can impact driver verification statuses positively or negatively.

5. **Local Driver Focus**
   - **Driver Demographics:** Target the recruitment of drivers from tier-2 and tier-3 cities, ensuring familiarity with local routes, culture, and languages.
   - **Community Engagement:** Create partnerships with local communities to better understand their needs and ensure drivers are seen as trustworthy and vital members of those communities.
